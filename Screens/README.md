# Screens and Visuals
This folder is to serve for all my references to what the screens should roughly look like in the end. 

### Key
![Black](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+) `Black` - Individual description of elements.

![Red](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff0000/000000?text=+) `Red` - Features or descriptions of functionality

![Yellow](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e6e600/000000?text=+) `Yellow` - Conditional features. (These features may not show up depending on circumstances.)
