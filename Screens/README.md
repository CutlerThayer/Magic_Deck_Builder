# Screens and Visuals
This folder is to serve for all my references to what the screens should roughly look like in the end. 

### Key
<span style="color:black">Black</span> - Individual description of elements.
<span style="color:red">Red</span> - Features or descriptions of functionality
<span style="color:gold">Yellow</span> - Conditional features. (These features may not show up depending on cicrcumstances.)
