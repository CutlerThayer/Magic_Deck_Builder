# Magic: the Gathering Deck Builder
The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly web application to build Magic: the Gathering decks, analyze cards, and save that information. 

This project is meant to be iterative. The goal with this is to make incremental progress over time. Because of this there should at least be some progress made at least twice a week until completed.

# API's
For this project I have decided to use the [Magic: the Gathering API](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/#api_v1formats_list). The reason for this is because while I could try to build an API myself with the entire list of cards, but it would probably be a lot of effort to currate that massive list. In order to save that time I have decided to use this API.

# Steps
<em>This is an iterative list so things could be added, removed, or crossed out at any time.</em>
* Figure out layout and screens
* Pick languages and frameworks
* Start building basic app (More details on this step later)
